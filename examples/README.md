Scripts for paper Mumax3-cQED: an extension of Mumax3 to simulate magnon-photon interactions in cavity QED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the scripts used for the paper *Mumax3-cQED: an extension of Mumax3 to simulate magnon-photon interactions in cavity QED*:

- **00-system-evolution-lam-0.mx3**: This script obtains the resonant frequency for a cube, as the Brms vector is zero, this script does not use the cavity feature. This script is a first step to check the Dicke model.
- **01-system-evolution-lam-0.2.mx3**: This script was used to obtain the interaction between the cavity and the spins in the Dicke model, it shows the hybridization of the system for the Dike model.
- **02-system-evolution-lam-0.3.mx3**: This script was used to obtain the interaction between the cavity and the spins in the Dicke model, it shows the hybridization of the system, the width of both peaks representing the cavity and the spins get broaden for the Dike model.
- **03-system-evolution-lam-0.4.mx3**:  This script was used to obtain the interaction between the cavity and the spins in the Dicke model, it shows the hybridization of the system, the width of both peaks representing the cavity and the spins get broaden for the Dike model.
- **04-system-evolution-superradiance.mx3**: The script shows the Dicke model in superradiance mode, here, the virtual photons become real and the system start releasing them, as result, the system falls into a stationary mode.
- **05-system-evolution-no-cavity-dissipation.mx3**: This script shows a nanowire in a cavity without cavity dissipation, the system shows the hybridization of the cavity and the spins.
- **06-system-evolution-cavity-dissipation.mx3**: This script shows a nanowire in a cavity with cavity dissipation, the system shows the hybridization of the cavity and the spins.
- **07-script-nanodisc.mx3**: This script shows a nanodisc in a cavity and creates a vortex.
